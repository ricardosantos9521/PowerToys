# Overview

<img src="./doc/images/overview/PT%20hero%20image.png"/>

Microsoft PowerToys is a set of utilities for power users to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity. Inspired by the [Windows 95 era PowerToys project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_PowerToys), this reboot provides power users with ways to squeeze more efficiency out of the Windows 10 shell and customize it for individual workflows.  A great overview of the Windows 95 PowerToys can be found [here](https://socket3.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/using-windows-95-powertoys/).

For a video overview of PowerToys, including install steps and a walkthrough of the available utilities, check out the [PowerToys: Utilities to customize Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-d7KiwpnMA) episode of Tabs vs Spaces on YouTube.

### PowerRename

[<img align="left" src="https://aka.ms/powerToysPowerRenameImageSmall" />](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_PowerRename) [PowerRename](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_PowerRename) is a Windows Shell Extension for advanced bulk renaming using search and replace or regular expressions. PowerRename allows simple search and replace or more advanced regular expression matching. While you type in the search and replace input fields, the preview area will show what the items will be renamed to. PowerRename then calls into the Windows Explorer file operations engine to perform the rename. This has the benefit of allowing the rename operation to be undone after PowerRename exits. This code is based on [Chris Davis's SmartRename](https://github.com/chrdavis/SmartRename).

## Installing and running Microsoft PowerToys

#### Requirements

- Have [.NET Core 3.1 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.4-windows-x64-installer). The installer should handle this but we want to directly make people aware.

#### 0.18 users for updating via notifications

- We adjusted how upgrading works in 0.20.  In 0.19 we accounted for this upcoming change but if you are going from 0.18 to 0.21, please directly use the installer file.

### Via GitHub with EXE [Recommended]

Install from the [Microsoft PowerToys GitHub releases page][github-release-link]. Click on `Assets` to show the files available in the release and then click on `PowerToysSetup-0.23.2-x64.exe` to download the PowerToys installer.

This is our preferred method.

### Via WinGet (Preview)
Download PowerToys from [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/releases). To install PowerToys, run the following command from the command line / PowerShell:

```powershell
WinGet install powertoys

### Other install methods

There are [community driven install methods](./doc/unofficalInstallMethods.md) such as Chocolatey and Scoop.  If these are your preferred install solutions, this will have the install instructions.

### Known issues
