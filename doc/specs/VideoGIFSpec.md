# Video GIF Capture Spec

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Executive Summary

Users are evolving to need to share more than just static images of their desktop. Given this fact, there becomes a need for a light-weight tool beyond the standard screenshot technologies that allows quick and easy screen recordings. Such tooling can enable an increased range of creative license for users to develop the visual experiences that truly bring their visions to life. While there is 3rd party software that exists for this purpose, these tools tend to provide overly complex functionalities that are excessive for simple use cases. Therefore, this document proposes the development of a lightweight, native Windows alternative to allow for fast and straight-forward screen recording and editing. This would allow for increased productivity and offer a familiar and intuitive UI experience based on similar Windows Shell tooling for easy onboarding.

### 1.2. Goals and Non-Goals

Goals:

* Create simple, lightweight recording tool
* Export to known visual standard format based on the desired usage

Non-goals:

* End to end complex editor
* Transcode *existing* video files to GIFs
* Transcode *existing* GIF files to videos
* Ability to open/edit prior recordings

### 1.3. Key Definitions/Concepts

Here are definitions of words and acronyms found throughout this document to ensure clarity:

* **VGC:** Video GIF Capture  –  The tentative name for this PowerToy.
* **Bounding Box:** The visual region on the screen which encases the desired content to be recorded. Typically designated by a rectangular border created by the capturing software that sits on the screen's foreground throughout the entirety of recording.

### 1.4. Narrative / Scenarios

#### 1.4.1. Example Use Cases

* Creating animated visuals for instructions/tutorials: Quickly capture relevant clips from videos or animations, which can be easily converted to a GIF and pasted into the documentation.
* Improved bug reporting on GitHub: Select the application to be recorded and capture the usage that causes the bug/crash in the program. Convert the recording to a GIF and attach it to the bug report.
* IT & administrative guidance: Easily record desktop to showcase the appropriate steps for proper machine configurations. Save the recording as a video and upload to desired distribution channels.
* Light-weight media alternatives: For sharing large media like 3D models, pictures and videos can be more effective than exporting the entire model itself. Using VGC, users can quickly record interactions with the model and save it as a video for export.
* Meme creation: Capture a snippet of a video, quickly trim and add text to the clip, and convert it to a GIF to share through popular social media.

#### 1.4.2. Key Scenarios

**GitHub Bug Reporting:** When reporting bugs or issues against a GitHub repository, it is often helpful for users to be able to attach visuals of the experience for developers to more easily reproduce and diagnose the issue. In many cases, a short recording of the application’s behavior is much more beneficial than screenshots or textual descriptions of the problem. With GitHub’s capacity to embed GIFs in the bug reports, Video GIF Capture is an ideal tool for quickly and seamlessly recording the application’s behavior, converting that recording to a GIF, and attaching the GIF to the GitHub bug log.
Outcome from Using VGC for Reporting: A successful VGC would enable a user to quickly launch and isolate the recording’s focus on the faulty application through window selection. Once the recording’s positioning is set, users can capture the application’s behavior through a familiar “Play/Pause/Stop” interface. After recording, a simplistic editor is loaded with an intuitive scrubbing bar for fast video trimming. Once editing is complete, the recording can then be copied to the clipboard as a GIF and pasted into the bug report.

**IT & Administrative Guidance:** Utilizing corporate devices and networks often requires tedious configuration steps to make sure proper authorizations can be granted to users. Typically, instructions of this nature are distributed through static documentation. With the assistance of VGC, visually guided steps can be generated to greatly improve the quality of instruction and reduce the likelihood of errors from misinterpretation.
Outcome from Using VGC for IT Guidance: A successful VGC would enable IT & administrators to begin a recording that captures their desktop screen. With the appropriate recording options set, VGC should capture all windows that are interacted with, in addition to overlaying the screen with guided keystrokes as they are pressed by the user. After recording, the user should then be able to trim the video and add optional text overlay as needed for clarification. Once editing is complete, the user should be able to save the final recording to the desired video format and export for distribution.

### 1.5. Existing Landscape

The following subsections of **1.5.** describe insights into the user experience of capturing a recording with existing software.

###### *Figure 1.5.1 - Original state of example screen to be recorded.*

![BaseScreen](./images/GIFSpec/BaseScreen.png "Screenshot of Halo Infinite Video")

#### 1.5.1. Xbox Game Bar

[Xbox Game Bar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-game-bar/9nzkpstsnw4p?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is a native Windows application that allows users to record their full screen by simply pressing the key binding: Win + Alt + R, for both starting and stopping the recording. A minimalistic recording widget is displayed while recording (Figure 1.5.2), yet removed from the final recording when played in the app’s gallery (Figure 1.5.3). Note that the gallery is accessed through the Xbox Game Bar menu (launched via Win + G), which includes a host of various options, settings, and metrics. To trim the recording, Xbox Game Bar’s interface has the user click through its gallery window, File Explorer, the Movies and TV app, and the Photos app before trimming functionality can be accessed (Figure 1.5.4).

#### 1.5.2. ScreenToGIF

[ScreenToGIF](https://www.screentogif.com/) is a free application that allows users to record a section of their screen. The launch menu (Figure 1.5.5) features a minimalistic set of options, and the recording interface (Figure 1.5.6) allows the user to drag and modify the bounding box around the desired content prior to recording. Note that there was a noticeable delay in the time from stopping the recording to opening the editing window as compared to other applications. Also note the verbose set of functionalities and editing options available in ScreenToGIF’s editing window (Figure 1.5.7).

#### 1.5.4. Snip and Sketch

[Snip and Sketch](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/snip-sketch/9mz95kl8mr0l?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) is a native Windows application that allows users to select sections of their screen to capture images of. While Snip and Sketch does not include recording functionality, we note this application because it captures the essence of simplicity and efficiency we hope to replicate in Video GIF Capture. Snip and Sketch’s intuitive interface (Figure 1.5.11) is quickly launched via the OS level key binding: Win + Shift + S. By selecting each option, the user easily becomes familiar with the range of applications. Once a section is captured, the image is immediately copied to the clipboard for usage in other applications. Snip and Sketch’s typical interaction time only takes a matter of seconds.

###### *Figure 1.5.11 - Snip and Sketch Selection Interface*

![Snip & Sketch](./images/GIFSpec/SnipAndSketch.png "Snip & Sketch Screenshot")

### 1.6. Opportunity for Impact

Given the software discussed in [**1.5 - Existing Landscape**](#15-Existing-Landscape), we aim to target Video GIF Capture as a lightweight, Windows native alternative to more verbose, feature-heavy applications like ScreenToGIF and Camtasia. Following Snip and Sketch’s intuitive and simple styling, Video GIF Capture should enable users to quickly ramp-up on its usage, and offer concise, efficient recording/editing options for common use cases as described in [**1.4 – Narrative / Scenarios**](#14-narrative--scenarios). By leveraging Windows native UI, we can create a familiar interaction experience that feels at home with similar Windows applications like Snip and Sketch, Xbox Game Bar, the Movies and TV app, and the Photos App. With an explicit focus on screen recording, we aim to streamline the user interface so that the overall time spent on the application can be comparable to Snip and Sketch’s fast interface, yet functionally equivalent to lightweight workloads on ScreenToGIF and Camtasia.

## 2. Definition of Success

### 2.1. Customers

Video GIF Capture is for power users and developers who are looking to tune and streamline their Windows experience for greater productivity and enhanced user experience.

### 2.2. Expected Impact: Customer, and Technology Outcomes

* **High Reliability:** Less than 0.1% crash rate.
* **High User Retention:** 25% or more of active PowerToys users who used VGC, use it again within 28 days.

### 3.3. Open Considerations

* DRM considerations
* Memory considerations when recording
* File size considerations for exporting
* Animated GIF 'copy to clipboard' functionality: Windows currently doesn't support animated GIF copying, so only a static non-animated variant can be stored on the clipboard
* Text overlay functionality
* PowerToys Settings menu options (ex: default encoder, cursor capture, click/touch capture, key stroke capture, pre-recording countdown, etc.)
* Multi-monitor display behaviors and Multi-DPI compatibility
* OS level shortcuts & hot-keys. Ex: Play, Stop, Pause, Resume, Cancel
* Command line/API
* Discoverability of features and settings
* Touch & Pen interaction considerations and supporting UI
* Supported export formats

## 4. Measure Requirements

|No. | Requirement | Implication |Pri. |
| - | - | - | - |
|1 | Total time of recording | Insight into memory requirements for application | P1 |
|2 | # of recordings captured | Information on the frequency of application usage | P1 |
|3 | # of recordings trimmed | Insights into potential editing optimizations | P1 |
|4 | Type of recording zone used | Allows us to recommend defaults to Windows developers | P1 |
|5 | # of times VGC was canceled | Continuous cancellations may imply shortcomings in UX and general usability | P1 |
|6 | % of successful renders | Allows us to track application reliability | P1 |
|7 | Final recording form (GIF vs MP4) | Allows us to track popularity of encoding format to prioritize further improvements and optimizations | P1 |
|8 | Number of times in past 28 days user has engaged with recording tool | Information on whether VGC is being utilized by PowerToys users | P1 |
|9 | Changes to default encoding | Allows us to recommend defaults to Windows developers | P1 |
|10| Size of recording | Insight into memory requirements for application | P1 |

## 5. Dependencies

* Depending on implementation, Snip and Sketch base code for zone selection
* Depending on implementation, Photos app base code for editor trimming
* Depending on implementation, ScreenToGIF as possible OSS base partner
* WinUI 3

## 6. Release Milestones

We plan to develop Video/GIF Capture in phases, gradually adding to the functionality as we complete the feature set described in this spec with each release. Below we list our tentative expectations for each major release of VGC.

|Release No. | Expectations |
| - | - |
|1 | All P0 requirements discussed in [Section 3](#3-requirements). Note that for this initial release we don't include video capture functionality (just GIF).|
|2 | P1 requirements for supporting video capture functionality in [Section 3.1.8](#318-editing). |
|3 | P1 requirements for region selection, recording and editing [Sections 3.1.2 - 3.1.8](#312-region-capture-dialog--mode-selection). |
|4 | P1 requirements for settings menu [Section 3.1.9](#319-settings-menu) |
|5 | P2 requirements for region selection, recording and editing [Sections 3.1.2 - 3.1.8](#312-region-capture-dialog--mode-selection). Note that this release primarily adds exact coordinate selection mode and the ability to adjust the selected region during the pre-recording stage. |
|6 | P2 requirements for settings menu [Section 3.1.9](#319-settings-menu). |
|7 | All P3 requirements discussed in [Section 3](#3-requirements) along with any miscellaneous work items that arise. |
